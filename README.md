# 15.odin_binary_search_tree

[Task Description](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/javascript-binary-search-trees)

In this lesson, I practice how to insert, find, delete a node in a Binary Search Tree. I get familiar with the concepts like height, depth, isBalanced of a tree. I implement four traversal methods: 1. Breadth-first traversal (levelOrder). 2. Depth-first traversal (preorder, inorder, postorder)

I learn:

1. [] == [] is false.
2. The usage of three dots(spread operator).
